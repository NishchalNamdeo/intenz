            From strategy to results <br />
            – through behaviour
          </h1>
          <h6>
            The good strategy is worth nothing without a behaviour <br />
            backing it up.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            If you want to succeed in lasting change, you must start with
            <br />behavior, actions, mindset, habits and leadership. With
            people.
          </h6>
          <h6>That’s where we enter into the picture.</h6>
          <h6>
            Results are about the right culture. The right mindset. And the
            <br />right behavior.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            At Intenz, we help you develop the behavior, strengthen the
            <br />mindset and fine-tune the skills that make the strategy
            produce results.
          </h6>
          <h6>
            We do this through close collaborations and development
            <br />processes within leadership, culture and sales.
